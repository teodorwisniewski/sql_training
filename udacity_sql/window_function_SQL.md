# Window function  exercices

Create a running total of standard_amt_usd (in the orders table) over order time with no date truncation. Your final table should have two columns: one with the amount being added for each new row, and a second with the running total.
```
  SELECT standard_amt_usd,
  SUM(standard_amt_usd) OVER
    (PARTITION BY occurred_at) AS running_total
  FROM orders
```
We have 2 same columns.

Now, modify your query from the previous quiz to include partitions. Still create a running total of standard_amt_usd (in the orders table) over order time, but this time, date truncate occurred_at by year and partition by that same year-truncated occurred_at variable. Your final table should have three columns: One with the amount being added for each row, one for the truncated date, and a final column with the running total within each year.
```
SELECT standard_amt_usd,
DATE_TRUNC('year',occurred_at) trucated_date,
SUM(standard_amt_usd) OVER
  (PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC('year',occurred_at)) AS running_total
FROM orders
```

Select the id, account_id, and total variable from the orders table, then create a column called total_rank that ranks this total amount of paper ordered (from highest to lowest) for each account using a partition. Your final table should have these four columns.

```
SELECT
	id, account_id, total,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY total DESC)
FROM orders
```

Now, create and use an alias to shorten the following query (which is different from the one in the Aggregates in Windows Functions video) that has multiple window functions. Name the alias account_year_window, which is more descriptive than main_window in the example above.

```
SELECT id,
       account_id,
       DATE_TRUNC('year',occurred_at) AS year,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER account_year_window AS dense_rank,
       total_amt_usd,
       SUM(total_amt_usd) OVER account_year_window AS sum_total_amt_usd,
       COUNT(total_amt_usd) OVER account_year_window AS count_total_amt_usd,
       AVG(total_amt_usd) OVER account_year_window AS avg_total_amt_usd,
       MIN(total_amt_usd) OVER account_year_window AS min_total_amt_usd,
       MAX(total_amt_usd) OVER account_year_window AS max_total_amt_usd
FROM orders
                                                   WINDOW account_year_window AS
(
  PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('year',occurred_at)
)                                                                            
```
